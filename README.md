**Introduction**

The Berlin Clock Kata is a popular exercise for practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) and pair programming. 
This exercise simulates a Berlin Clock, which visually represents time using a series of lights.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
Git
, Node.js

You can verify the installation with:
npm -v

**Description**

The Berlin Clock is composed of lights that indicate the current time:

* Seconds Light: A single light at the top; it’s on for even seconds, off for odd seconds.

* First row: 4 red lights, each representing a 5-hour block.

* Second row: 4 red lights, each representing a 1-hour block.
  
* First row: 11 lights, where every third light is red (representing 5-minute blocks) and the rest are yellow.

* Second row: 4 yellow lights, each representing a 1-minute block.

**Steps**

1. Simple Minutes Row: Implement the row representing single minutes.

2. 5-Minute Blocks Row: Implement the row for 5-minute intervals.

3. Simple Hours Row: Implement the row for single hours.

4. 5-Hour Blocks Row: Implement the row for 5-hour intervals.

5. Seconds Light: Implement the single light for seconds.

6. Full Berlin Clock: Integrate all rows to create the full Berlin Clock.

**Development Approach**

Work in pairs and follow the TDD methodology:

Write a test for each step, implement the code, then refactor as needed.
